## [Assignment Task 2]()

## Application Task 3

1. Set up a web application on Heroku or Digital Ocean Droplet with a user interface where we can input a named-entity and get the comparison between the news and twitter sentiments as an output.
    
    The App is an API driven architecture where an api is deployed on a server and the front end is written is React.
    
    API doc:
    
    - POST | /tweet/:keyword | - to fetch top 5 tweets and return their sentiments. 
    - POST | /news/:keyword  | - to fetch top 5 news articles and return their sentiments.
     
    I have used pm2 to monitor the app and restart it in case of failure.
